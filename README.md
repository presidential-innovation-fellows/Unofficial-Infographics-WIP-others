Unofficial-Infographics-WIP-others
==================================

This is a repo to hold infographics, diagrams, texts, etc. about the PIF program.

NOTE: Unlike most of our repos, these works are NOT in the Public Domain.

Because these are UNOFFICIAL works which are still in progress, these works are controlled
by the individual licenses on the individual file.  If there is no license, they 
are considered copyrighted by the auther and all rights are reserved.

This is counter to the general habit of the Fellows, which is to do all work in the 
Public Domain.  Nonetheless, it makes sense for this repo, and we hope it will not deter
people from making artistic contributions.

The purpose of these Infographics are of course to promote the Presidential Innovation
Fellowship, so much of this material will become publicly retransmittable---when the time is right.
Until that time, please respect our reservation of copyright and to not copy or transmit them.

You are, of course, free to read them and propose new ones and, like any copyrighted work, you
have the right of "fair use" under American copyright law.  We are making this repo public
to invite your participation.

The first file in repo, "PIF Project", was created by Rishi Shohoni under a CreativeCommons
license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported).
It was developed from concept created by Robert L. Read as an attempt to show all the people 
benefiting from the Round 2 Fellowship projects and to show some portion of the technologies they
do and don't employ.
